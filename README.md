## About Us

Mangadom was created out of a love for manga and a desire to build something enjoyable while practicing Next.js skills. The design and layout were inspired by creative works on [Dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/16894791-Manga-Web-Concept). We use the [Kitsu API](https://kitsu.docs.apiary.io/) to provide comprehensive manga data.
